# Campora – College Admission & Student Enquiry Portal

**Campora** is a centralized, multi-college SaaS admission and student
enquiry platform. Colleges register and manage their own admission process
on Campora; students discover colleges, browse courses, and submit
admission enquiries — all from one platform, instead of visiting a dozen
different college websites.

> "Connecting Students with the Right Future."

Developed by **Pushkar Srivastava**. © 2026 Campora. All Rights Reserved.

**Platform roles**: Super Admin (manages the platform), College Admin /
College Staff (manage their own college's courses and enquiries), and
Student (browses colleges, submits enquiries). See "Architecture" below.

Data is stored in MySQL (Amazon RDS in production) and the application is
deployed on AWS EC2.

_Note: internal project/package name (`college_admission`), Django app names
(`core`, `accounts`, `admissions`, `courses`, `dashboard`), database name
(`college_admission_db`), and folder structure are unchanged — only
user-facing branding is "Campora."_

## Features

Implemented so far:
- Project foundation: Django project + 5 modular apps (`core`, `accounts`,
  `admissions`, `courses`, `dashboard`)
- Campora branding: navbar, footer, admin site, design system
- Bootstrap 5 responsive base template with sticky navbar and footer
- Static/media file configuration
- Local MySQL database configuration via environment variables
- **Multi-college platform architecture**:
  - Custom `User` model (`accounts.User`) with 4 roles: Super Admin,
    College Admin, College Staff, Student — see "Architecture & Roles"
  - `StudentProfile` / `StaffProfile` role-extension models
  - `College` model (`courses` app) with an approval-workflow `status`
    field (Pending/Approved/Rejected/Suspended) — only Approved colleges
    are ever shown publicly
  - `Course` belongs to exactly one `College`; course names are unique
    **per college**, not globally (two colleges can both offer "BBA")
  - `Enquiry` references both `College` and `Course` — `college` is
    auto-derived from `course.college` on save and is not independently
    editable, so the two can never drift out of sync
  - Soft-delete support on `Enquiry` via a custom manager, field
    validators, and database indexes
- Django admin registered for all models: search, filters, fieldsets, and
  actions (soft-delete/restore on Enquiry; approve/reject/suspend on
  College)
- Idempotent sample data seeding via `python manage.py seed_data`
  (colleges, college admins/staff, students, courses, enquiries)
- **Full public website**: Home (hero, platform stats, featured colleges,
  why-choose-us, CTA), About (platform mission/vision/values), **Colleges**
  (searchable/filterable directory), **College Detail** (profile, contact
  info, active courses, gallery placeholder, at-a-glance stats), Courses
  (grouped by college), Contact (platform-level, validated enquiry form)
- Reusable `course_card` / `college_card` template partials
- Structured logging configured (console handler, per-app loggers)
- **Admission Enquiry submission** (Phase 4): students submit a course-
  specific enquiry directly from a college's "Enquire Now" button — no
  College/Course dropdown to fill in, since the course (and its college)
  is fixed by the page the student came from. Works anonymously per
  Version 1.0 scope; auto-links the enquiry to a logged-in Student's
  account when one is signed in. Server-side validated (Django Forms,
  reusing the existing field validators), Post/Redirect/Get, with a
  confirmation page showing a reference number.
- **Enquiry Management** (Phase 5): staff-facing listing (paginated,
  20/page) and detail views under `/dashboard/enquiries/`. Platform Admin
  sees every enquiry; College Admin/Staff see only their own college's
  enquiries (ownership-enforced — another college's enquiry 404s rather
  than 403s, so its existence isn't even confirmed). Every row/detail page
  always shows the associated College and Course.
- **Search, Filter & Sorting** (Phase 6): the enquiry listing now supports
  live search (student name, mobile, email, college or course — matches
  any of them), filters (college — Platform Admin only, course, gender,
  status, admission year), and sortable columns (student name, college,
  course, submission date, either direction). All combine together (AND),
  pagination preserves the active search/filter/sort across pages, and a
  malformed or hand-edited querystring degrades gracefully to "no filter"
  instead of erroring. College Admin/Staff never get a college filter and
  their course choices are restricted to their own college — the same
  ownership rule the rest of the dashboard follows.
- **Update Module** (Phase 7): staff can now edit any field on an
  enquiry — including reassigning its College and Course — from
  `/dashboard/enquiries/<id>/edit/`. The College and Course dropdowns are
  a genuine pair: picking a College narrows the Course dropdown (a small
  progressive-enhancement script for Platform Admin; College Admin/Staff
  simply never see other colleges' courses at all), and the pairing is
  re-validated server-side regardless of what the browser sent
  (`course.college` must match the selected `college`, or the form is
  redisplayed with a field-level error). This does **not** loosen the
  "college is auto-derived from course" rule above — the College
  dropdown drives validation/UX, but saving the form still only ever
  changes `course`, and `Enquiry.save()` re-derives `college` from it the
  same way it always has. College Admin/Staff get a College field that's
  rendered `disabled`, so even a hand-crafted POST body can't move an
  enquiry to another college — Django disabled fields always use their
  server-set initial value and silently ignore submitted data. Success
  and validation-error messages both surface via the existing Bootstrap
  alert / Django-messages integration.
- **Delete & Restore** (Phase 8): enquiries are soft-deleted by default —
  "delete" (from the enquiry list or detail page, with a confirm prompt)
  moves an enquiry to a **Recycle Bin** (`/dashboard/enquiries/recycle-bin/`)
  rather than removing it, so there is never a one-click, irreversible
  data-loss action. From the Recycle Bin, any staff role that manages
  enquiries can **Restore** a record back to the active list. **Permanent
  deletion** is a deliberate second step, restricted to administrators
  (Platform Admin / College Admin — College Staff can soft-delete and
  restore but not permanently delete) and can *only* be performed on a
  record that's already in the Recycle Bin — there's no path from the
  active list straight to permanent deletion. College ownership scoping
  applies throughout: a College Admin/Staff user's Recycle Bin only shows
  their own college's deleted enquiries, and delete/restore/permanent-
  delete on another college's enquiry 404s the same way the rest of the
  dashboard does. This uses the soft-delete manager (`Enquiry.objects` /
  `Enquiry.all_objects`, `is_deleted`, `soft_delete()`/`restore()`) that
  was already built into the model back in Phase 2/Platform Refactor —
  every Phase 4–7 query already excluded soft-deleted rows automatically,
  so this phase only had to add the delete/restore/recycle-bin views
  themselves.

Planned (see `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.docx` for the full phase roadmap):
Full analytics dashboard, CSV/Excel export, AWS deployment.

## Architecture & Roles

Campora uses **one custom Django user model** (`accounts.User`) with a
`role` field, rather than separate authentication systems per role:

| Role | Scope |
|---|---|
| **Super Admin** | Manages the whole platform: approves/rejects/suspends colleges, manages users, views platform-wide analytics |
| **College Admin** | Manages their own college's profile, courses, staff, and enquiries |
| **College Staff** | Works under a College Admin: views/updates enquiries assigned to their college |
| **Student** | Browses colleges/courses, submits enquiries, (future) tracks enquiry status |

Data model: `User` → `StudentProfile` (Student role) or `StaffProfile`
(College Admin / College Staff role, linked to a `College`).

## Authentication & Authorization

Login/logout, registration, and role-based access control were all built
during the Platform Refactor — ahead of their originally-numbered slot in
`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.docx` (Phase 9), because the multi-college
architecture couldn't be meaningfully built or tested without them. Phase
9 in this codebase is a **verification pass** confirming the existing
implementation already satisfies its spec in full, rather than new
functionality (see PHASE_STATUS.docx and CHANGELOG.md `[0.9.1]` for the
verification details).

- **Login / logout**: Django's built-in `LoginView`/`LogoutView`
  (`accounts/views.py`, `accounts/urls.py`) with Campora-branded Bootstrap
  5 templates. Logout is a POST-only form (not a GET link) in the navbar
  — required by Django 5.x's `LogoutView` for CSRF safety.
- **Registration**: self-service student sign-up only
  (`accounts/views.py::register_student`) — College Admin/Staff accounts
  are provisioned by a College Admin via `/dashboard/college/staff/`, not
  self-registered, matching the platform's role hierarchy.
- **Every management page requires login.** `dashboard/views.py`'s
  entry point (`dashboard_home`) and every dashboard view is decorated
  with either `@login_required` or `@role_required(...)`
  (`accounts/decorators.py`) — there is no dashboard/management URL that
  skips this. Public pages (Home, Colleges, Course browsing, Contact,
  and submitting an enquiry) intentionally remain open to anonymous
  visitors, per `PROJECT_BRAIN.docx`'s Version 1.0 scope ("Students
  submit enquiries without authentication").
- **Redirect behaviour is intentionally split in two**, matching Django
  best practice rather than blanket-redirecting everyone:
  - **Anonymous** users hitting any protected page are redirected to
    `/accounts/login/?next=<original URL>` — logging in then lands them
    back on the page they actually wanted, not just the dashboard root.
  - **Authenticated users with the wrong role** (e.g. a Student hitting
    `/dashboard/platform/`, or College Staff hitting the admin-only
    `/dashboard/college/staff/` or a permanent-delete URL) get a genuine
    **403 Forbidden**, not a redirect — silently redirecting an
    authenticated user who is deliberately trying (or accidentally
    linked into) a page they can't use would either loop confusingly or
    mask the permission error.
- **College ownership**, layered on top of role checks, is enforced by
  `accounts/decorators.py::get_staff_college` everywhere a College
  Admin/Staff user touches data — see Phases 4–8 above for the many
  cross-college-access tests (all 404, never 403, so another college's
  data is never even confirmed to exist).

## Technology Stack

Python, Django 5.2 (LTS), Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, MySQL, AWS (EC2, RDS, EBS, IAM, S3).
Campora design system: Poppins (headings) + Inter (body), Lucide icons,
color palette defined in `static/css/style.css`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real values:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Create the local MySQL database (matching `.env` `DB_NAME`):
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE college_admission_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
   ```
6. **If you have an existing local database from before this phase**, drop
   and recreate it (see "⚠️ Breaking Change" below — this phase introduces
   a custom user model, which Django cannot apply on top of an already
   migrated default `auth.User` table):
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE college_admission_db;
   CREATE DATABASE college_admission_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
   ```
7. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
8. Seed sample colleges, users (Platform Admin, College Admins/Staff,
   Students), courses and enquiries:
   ```
   python manage.py seed_data
   ```
   All seeded users share the password `Campora@12345` (development only).
   Notable seeded logins: `superadmin`, `admin_campora_institute_of_technology`,
   `staff_campora_institute_of_technology`, `priya_sharma` (student).
9. (Optional) Create your own Django superuser for `/admin/`:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
10. Start the development server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` for the public site, or
    `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/` to log in as any seeded role
    and reach your role-specific dashboard at `/dashboard/`.

## ⚠️ Breaking Change: Custom User Model

This phase introduces `accounts.User` as `AUTH_USER_MODEL`. Django does
not support switching to a custom user model once migrations have been
applied against the default one — so if you previously ran `migrate` on
this project (Phases 1–3), **you must drop and recreate your local
database** before running `migrate` again. This is a one-time step; there
is no real production data to lose at this stage (only seeded/test data).

## Environment Variables

Defined in `.env` (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key |
| `DEBUG` | `True` in development, `False` in production |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated list of allowed hosts |
| `DB_NAME` | MySQL database name |
| `DB_USER` | MySQL user |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | MySQL password |
| `DB_HOST` | MySQL host |
| `DB_PORT` | MySQL port (default `3306`) |

## Usage

- **Students** browse Colleges → College Details → Courses on the public
  site, with or without an account, and can submit an **Admission Enquiry**
  directly from any course's "Enquire Now" button — no account required.
  They can also register/log in for a personal dashboard
  (`/dashboard/student/`); enquiries submitted while logged in are
  automatically linked to their account.
- **College Admins** log in to manage their own college's staff
  (`/dashboard/college/staff/`), browse their college's enquiries
  (`/dashboard/enquiries/`) and view individual enquiry details
  (`/dashboard/enquiries/<id>/`) — strictly scoped to their own college.
- **College Staff** log in to view their college's dashboard and its
  enquiries (same `/dashboard/enquiries/` listing, scoped to their own
  college; staff management is Admin-only).
- **Platform Admin** logs in to `/dashboard/platform/` to approve/reject/
  suspend colleges, see platform-wide stats, and browse **every**
  college's enquiries via the same `/dashboard/enquiries/` listing.

Search/filter/sort (Phase 6), edit (Phase 7), and delete/restore
(Phase 8) are all live at `/dashboard/enquiries/` and its Recycle Bin.

## AWS Deployment

Planned for Phases 13–14: EC2 + Gunicorn + Nginx + Amazon RDS + EBS + S3.
Not yet implemented.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Phase 1: `python manage.py check` passes, static files collect, all
      routes return correct HTTP responses, base template renders correctly
- [x] Phase 2: Migrations apply cleanly (`courses.0001_initial`,
      `admissions.0001_initial`); `seed_data` command is idempotent; model
      validators correctly reject invalid mobile numbers, out-of-range
      percentages, and past admission years; soft-delete manager correctly
      excludes deleted records by default; Django admin verified end-to-end
      (login, Course list, Enquiry list including soft-deleted rows)
- [x] Phase 3: Home/About/Courses/Contact routes all return 200; Courses
      page correctly lists only active courses (5 of 6 seeded, excluding
      the inactive Diploma); Contact form rejects invalid input (6 inline
      errors shown) and accepts valid input (302 redirect, success message
      shown, submission logged); accessibility verified (all 5 form fields
      have associated `<label for>`, error messages carry `role="alert"`)
- [x] Multi-college refactor: `College`/`Course`/`Enquiry` relationships
      verified (zero `enquiry.college` / `course.college` mismatches across
      9 seeded enquiries); per-college course-name uniqueness confirmed in
      both directions (same name allowed at a different college, rejected
      at the same college); `Colleges`/`College Detail`/grouped `Courses`
      pages all verified; search and state-filter verified
- [x] Authentication & RBAC foundation: custom `AUTH_USER_MODEL` migrates
      cleanly from scratch; login/logout/student-registration verified;
      role-based `403`s verified for every cross-role attempt (College
      Admin → Platform Dashboard, College Staff → Manage Staff, Student →
      Platform Dashboard); **college-ownership isolation verified** — a
      College Admin can only ever create staff for, or view data from,
      their own college (tested by attempting to add staff "for" another
      college and confirming the created account was scoped to the
      *actor's* college regardless); `seed_data` idempotency re-confirmed
      after the rewrite
- [x] Phase 4: Admission Enquiry submission verified end-to-end via
      Django's test client — GET the enquiry form for a live course
      (200); valid POST creates an `Enquiry` with `college` correctly
      auto-derived from the course's college, then redirects (302) to a
      working confirmation page (200); invalid POST (bad mobile number)
      re-renders the form with errors (200) and creates no record;
      enquiry URLs for an inactive course or a nonexistent course both
      correctly return 404; Home/Colleges/College Detail/Courses/Contact
      re-verified with no regressions
- [x] Phase 5: Enquiry Management verified end-to-end via Django's test
      client for all 3 staff roles — Platform Admin sees every enquiry
      (count cross-checked against the DB total, 200); College Admin/Staff
      see only their own college's enquiries (count cross-checked, 200);
      cross-college detail access correctly 404s (ownership isolation);
      own-college detail access returns 200 with correct data; Student
      role correctly blocked (403); anonymous correctly redirected to
      login (302); pagination verified with 25 bulk-created records
      (page 1/2 both 200, out-of-range and below-range page numbers both
      clamp to 200 instead of erroring — this caught and fixed a real
      `EmptyPage` bug in the initial pagination template); all previously
      working public and dashboard routes re-verified with no regressions
- [x] Phase 6: Search, Filter & Sorting verified end-to-end via Django's
      test client — search matched correctly on student name, email and
      college name substrings (results cross-checked against expected
      matches); college filter, course filter, gender filter, status
      filter and admission-year filter each verified independently
      (every returned row confirmed to match the filter); combined
      filters correctly AND together; sort verified in both directions
      for student name, college, course and submission date (result
      order cross-checked against Python's own `sorted()`); a malformed
      querystring (`admission_year=notanumber&sort=bogus&dir=bogus&
      gender=Z&status=BOGUS`) degrades to "no filter" instead of
      erroring (200, full unfiltered count); pagination combined with an
      active filter preserves that filter across pages (verified with
      25 bulk-created records, second-page results still 100% matching
      the filter, and the page-2 querystring correctly excludes `page`
      but keeps the filter); College Admin's filter form was confirmed
      to have no `college` field at all, and injecting a `?college=`
      query param for another college was confirmed to have zero effect
      (still scoped to their own college — ownership rule holds);
      Phase 4/Phase 5 regression-checked with no breakage (own-college
      detail 200, cross-college detail 404, Student 403, anonymous 302,
      Home/Colleges routes 200)
- [x] Phase 7: Update Module verified end-to-end via Django's test client
      — Platform Admin's edit form confirmed to have an enabled `college`
      field pre-selected to the enquiry's current college; College
      Admin/Staff's form confirmed to have `college` restricted to just
      their own college **and** `disabled`; a valid edit (name, status,
      staff notes) confirmed to persist and redirect to the detail page
      with a success message; reassigning an enquiry to a course in a
      genuinely different college (Platform Admin) confirmed to update
      both `course` and the auto-derived `college` together; submitting a
      college/course pair that don't actually match confirmed to
      redisplay the form with a field-level error and leave the database
      record unchanged; an out-of-range value (percentage > 100)
      confirmed to redisplay with a field-level error; a College
      Admin's attempt to inject a different college via a hand-crafted
      POST body confirmed to have **zero effect** (disabled field, server
      ignores submitted value); a College Admin's attempt to select
      another college's course (outside their restricted queryset)
      confirmed to be rejected as an invalid choice; cross-college edit
      access confirmed to 404 on both GET and POST (verified with a
      valid CSRF token, so the 404 is the view's own ownership check, not
      just CSRF rejection); Student (403) and anonymous (302) both
      re-confirmed blocked; Phase 4/5/6 regression pass (public routes,
      enquiry list + search, enquiry detail) all still 200
- [x] Phase 8: Delete & Restore verified end-to-end via Django's test
      client — a GET to the delete URL confirmed to be a no-op (no state
      change, matching the approve/reject/suspend-college convention
      already used elsewhere in this app); a POST soft-deletes (flips
      `is_deleted`) and immediately disappears from the active list and
      404s on its own detail page (confirming `Enquiry.objects`, the
      default manager, already excludes it); the same record confirmed
      to appear in the Recycle Bin (`Enquiry.all_objects`); Restore
      confirmed to flip it back and make the detail page reachable again;
      **two-step safety** confirmed directly — attempting to
      permanently-delete a record that is *not yet* in the Recycle Bin
      returns 404 (the row is untouched), and only after soft-deleting it
      first does permanent deletion succeed and the row actually vanish
      from `Enquiry.all_objects`; College Staff confirmed able to
      soft-delete and restore but blocked (403, both GET and POST) from
      permanent deletion, and the Recycle Bin template's
      `can_permanently_delete` flag confirmed `False` for that role so
      the button isn't even rendered; College Admin confirmed able to
      permanently delete within their own college; cross-college
      isolation re-verified for all three new actions (soft-delete,
      restore, permanent-delete each 404 on another college's enquiry,
      leaving it completely untouched); Student (403) and anonymous
      (302) both re-confirmed blocked from the Recycle Bin; full
      Phase 4–7 regression pass (public routes, enquiry list, sort,
      enquiry edit) all still 200
- [x] Phase 9: Authentication & Authorization — **verification pass**,
      no code changes (already fully implemented in the Platform
      Refactor). Verified via Django's test client: login with correct
      credentials authenticates and redirects to the role-appropriate
      dashboard; login with a wrong password redisplays the form with a
      non-field error and does not authenticate; logout (POST, matching
      the actual navbar form — Django 5.x's `LogoutView` is POST-only)
      clears the session; every one of the 7 management URLs tested
      (`/dashboard/`, `/dashboard/platform/`, `/dashboard/college/`,
      `/dashboard/college/staff/`, `/dashboard/student/`,
      `/dashboard/enquiries/`, `/dashboard/enquiries/recycle-bin/`)
      redirects an anonymous visitor to `/accounts/login/?next=<url>`;
      logging in via that link lands back on the originally-requested
      page, not just the dashboard root; a Student and (separately)
      College Staff each hitting every page outside their role
      (platform dashboard, college dashboard, manage-staff,
      enquiry list, recycle bin, permanent-delete) get a real **403**,
      not a silent redirect or 200; the correct role for each of those
      pages gets **200**; `dashboard_home` routes all 4 roles to the
      right landing page; public pages (Home, About, Colleges, Courses,
      Contact, Login, Register) remain reachable without authentication,
      confirming the intentionally-public Version 1.0 scope wasn't
      accidentally locked down; CSRF protection confirmed active on the
      login form itself (POST without a token → 403)
- [ ] Full analytics dashboard; CSV export — not yet built (future
      phases)
