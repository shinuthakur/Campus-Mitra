"""
Forms for the accounts app.

Two distinct creation paths, matching the platform's role hierarchy:
- Students self-register (StudentSignUpForm).
- College Admin / College Staff accounts are *provisioned*, not
  self-registered: a College Admin creates College Staff for their own
  college; a Platform Admin creates College Admins for a college
  (StaffCreationForm). The college is always passed in by the view from
  the requesting user's own context — never a form field — so a College
  Admin cannot provision staff for a college they don't own.

No email verification / OTP / social login: out of scope for this phase
per the platform vision document.
